## Our Story

### How Meaning of Claw Was Born

It started with a simple problem: **Release notes that made no sense.**

Every few weeks, OpenClaw would update with dozens of changes. The official changelog was accurate but cryptic—full of technical terms, obscure references, and zero context about why you should care.

We found ourselves spending 30+ minutes after every release trying to understand:
- What actually changed
- Whether it affected our setups
- If we needed to do anything
- What new features were available

And we thought: *This is ridiculous. Why isn't there a clear, human explanation of what's going on?*

### The First ClawBrief

So we started writing ClawBrief—short, plain-English summaries of each OpenClaw release, translated for regular people like us.

The response was immediate:
- "Finally! I actually understand what's happening."
- "This saves me 20 minutes every week."
- "How do I get this automatically delivered?"
- "Why doesn't OpenClaw do this themselves?"

Turns out, we weren't the only ones who wanted clear explanations instead of cryptic changelog entries.

### From Newsletter to Bible

As ClawBrief grew, so did the questions:
- "How do I set this up for my Mac?"
- "Can you explain what the Gateway actually does?"
- "What's the difference between local and cloud models?"
- "How do I automate my morning routine?"

The documentation existed, but it was written for developers. It answered "what" but not "why." It assumed you already knew the jargon.

We realized: People needed a complete guide—from absolute beginner to confident user. Something written in plain English. Something that explains the architecture, not just the commands.

That's how The OpenClaw Bible was born.

## Our Mission

### Making AI Accessible to Everyone

The AI revolution is here, but the tools are built by technical people for technical people. We believe that's backwards.

**OpenClaw is powerful software that deserves an accessible guide.**

Our mission is to make it possible for non-technical people to:
- Set up their own AI assistant
- Understand what they're doing and why
- Feel confident making changes
- Automate tedious parts of their digital lives

### What We Believe

**Privacy by Default**  
Your data should be yours. OpenClaw lets you use local AI models that never send your information to external servers. We believe that's how it should be.

**Understanding Over Memorization**  
We don't just give you commands to copy and paste. We explain how things work, so you can solve your own problems and customize for your needs.

**Quality Over Hype**  
We won't sell you something we wouldn't use ourselves. The Bible is comprehensive because that's what we wished existed when we started.

**Community Over Competition**  
OpenClaw is open source. We're not competing with it—we're complementing it. The more people who understand and use OpenClaw, the better the ecosystem for everyone.

## Who We Are

We're a small team of OpenClaw users who got tired of digging through GitHub releases and wanted clear documentation.

**Our Team:**
- Technical writers with a knack for explaining complex stuff simply
